This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with certain aspect ratios.  The image captured is sometimes distorted or incorrectly sized. This is particularly noticeable when the aspect ratio is not 1:1. The problem seems to be related to how Expo handles the camera preview and the final image output.
